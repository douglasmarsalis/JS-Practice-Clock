# JS-Practice-Clock

## [![License: APACHE2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License:_MIT-orange)](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)

## Description
This is practice 2/24 using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript building a simple digital clock.  My goals are to continue my coding practice and also to have an easy source for code that I can use in future projects.  I have also included notes in the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for help if needed in the future. There are also links for other clock designs.
